						## Containerized Development Environments
						04/20/21

						---

						### Goals
						- Start to demystify the process
						  - At the end of the day, it's all just code!
						- Share knowledge to help with debugging common issues

						---

						### Disclaimer
						![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/234/739/fa5.jpg)

						__notes__
						- Very little experience w/ all of this!
						- Grains of salt, just want to share what I have learned so far, to hopefully save others time digging through confusing code.

						---

						### Why do we even do this?
						- Enforce consistency between each contributor's environment, less "works on my machine"
						- Automates installation of dependencies, keeps them isolated from your machine, reduce clutter
						- Better approximation of production environment (not perfect yet)

						__notes__
						- Dependencies: anyone who has tried to install Postgres (esp. multiple versions) will know this pain
						- Cons are addressed later

						---

						### Infrastructure - Docker
						- Defines Images, manages individual Containers
						- `Dockerfile` - definition of Image, relevant in all environments

						__notes__
						- Gross over-simplifications:
						  - Containers are like super-lightweight virtual machines, share the host OS and resources
							- Images are how Containers are defined (like Class / Instance in OOP)
						- Not going into too much detail into how Docker works, b/c of time and own ignorance

						---

						### Infrastructure - Docker
						Example: `homes`

						__notes__
						- Very brief

						---

						### Infrastructure - Docker Compose
						- Manages _orchestration_ of Containers
						- `docker-compose.yml` - **ONLY RELEVANT IN DEVELOPMENT**
							- The corresponding staging/production tool is Kubernetes

						__notes__
						- Similarly, not going into too much detail into how Docker Compose works
						- I believe Core Tech is currently looking into replacing Docker Compose w/ kubernetes for more true-to-deployed local envs

						---

						### Infrastructure - Docker Compose
						Example: `homes`

						__notes__
						- Talk very briefly about volumes, and how DB volume works
						- Briefly mention multiple Dockerfiles, will go over in one of the walkthroughs

						---

						### Infrastructure - `make` commands
						- The most confusing part, syntax is NOT intuitive for most (I imagine)
						- `make` is generally used for building C/C++ programs, we use it here as a more generic build tool

						---

						### Infrastructure - `make` commands
						Examples:

						```Makefile
						# simple rule
						homes-db-start:
								docker-compose up -d db

						# rule w/ prerequisites
						start: am-i-logged-in .env generate-auto-ports deps
								docker-compose up --build ${docker-compose-options}

						# rule w/ prerequisites, command uses multiple Docker Compose files
						start-watch: am-i-logged-in .env generate-auto-ports deps ${build-dir}
								docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build ${docker-compose-options}
						```

						---

						### Walkthrough #1
						`make homes-db-start`

						---

						### Walkthrough #2
						`make start`

						__notes__
						- Start at definition, look at how other files add prerequisites

						---

						### Walkthrough #3
						`make start-watch`

						__notes__
						- Example of difficulty "extending" another rule,

						---

						### Pain points

						- Speed! Some common container startup steps (e.g. helm charts) take a while, unclear why sometimes
						- Difficultly using `make` commands if unfamiliar w/ syntax:
							- Sometimes confusing output, e.g. migrations appearing to run when they do not really
							- Difficult to "extend" a task, e.g. `make start-watch` in homes
						- Tests can be **very** slow to start up (e.g. `homes`) possibly depends on test framework used

						__notes__
						- We know these well! Not an exhaustive list
						- Make "extend": maybe not just difficult, but impossible?
						- Tests: current theory is that Jest is primary culprit in `homes`
